Typica .ts Generator

This is a program that scrapes a Typica configuration and generates a .ts file
translators can use so that user visible text in that configuration can be
translated into another language.

This is very slapdash with a minimal feature set focusing on the Typica 1.7
release. There are certain valid Typica configurations that this will fail on.
This is very much tailored to use with the currently provided example
configuration. If you're using Typica for something strange this tool might need
to be altered.

The good news is that you should never need to run this yourself.
